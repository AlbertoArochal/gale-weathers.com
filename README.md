# Project Readme: Gale Weathers Website Clone

This project is a clone of the original website for Gale Weathers, a fictional character from the Scream movie franchise. The website was created as part of the promotional campaign for Scream 3 when it was released in 2000. The goal of this project is to experiment with reproducing an old website using modern tools and technologies, and to see how it would be created in today's world.

## Technologies Used
This project was built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, with Vite as the bundler and Typescript for type checking. React allows for easy management of complex UI components, while Vite is a build tool that provides fast and efficient development and production builds. Typescript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that provides type checking and better code organization.

## Scream Movie Trilogy
The Scream trilogy is a horror film series that began in 1996 and centers around a group of friends who are targeted by a masked killer known as Ghostface. The movies are known for their self-awareness and satire of the horror genre, and have been praised for their clever writing and use of suspense.

## Project Overview
This project is a faithful reproduction of the original Gale Weathers website, complete with all of its original features and content. The website includes sections for news, photos, and biographical information about the character, as well as a guestbook where users can leave comments. The site has been recreated using modern technologies and tools, and has been optimized for performance and accessibility.
